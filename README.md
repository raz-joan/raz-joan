### Hi there 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer 👩🏼‍💻 that was previously a math student and teacher 🧮, as well as a baker and miller 🌾.

In my previous experiences, I learned that life is made up of algorithms. Rules give space to creativity. In the same way that theoretical math and sourdough fermentation became cozy houses, I am finding that software engineering is a place of challenge and rest.

If you'd like to be in touch, then please email me! --> raz.joan@gmail.com
