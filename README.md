### Hi there, I'm Joan 👋🏻

I'm a front-end engineering student at the [Turing School](https://turing.edu/). I am an empathetic and gentle human, a creative thinker, a detail-oriented problem-solver, and am incredibly motivated to make everything that I touch better.

In my previous experiences as a math student and teacher 🧮, as well as a baker and miller 🌾, I learned that life is made up of algorithms. Rules give space to creativity. In the same way that theoretical math and sourdough fermentation became cozy houses, I am finding that software engineering is a place of challenge and rest.

When I am not writing JavaScript, CSS $ HTML, or learning a new technology 👩🏼‍💻, then I am most likely on the lookout for a new place to walk/hike/bike/camp 🏔, a scene to draw 🖋, or a new food to bake/cook 🥘.

If you'd like to be in touch, then please email me! --> raz.joan@gmail.com
